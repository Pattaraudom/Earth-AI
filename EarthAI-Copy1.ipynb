Traditional construction methods entail single-use designs that require frequent demolitions, leading to resource depletion and wastage.\",\n",
    "    solution = \"Herein, we propose an innovative approach to mitigate this problem: Modular Construction. This method embraces recycling and reuse, taking a significant stride towards a circular economy.   Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources.  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time.  We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.\"\n",

      "(a) Circularity Potential: The proposed idea of modular construction aligns well with the principles of circular economy. By designing components for easy disassembly and reuse, it promotes resource efficiency and waste reduction. The potential for reducing construction waste by up to 90% is significant. Score: 9/10\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Scalability: The modular construction approach is highly scalable. It can be adopted in various contexts and regions, given the universal nature of construction activities. The fact that it is already being implemented in markets globally is a positive indicator. Score: 8/10\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Innovation and Novelty: While modular construction is not a new concept, its application in promoting circularity in the construction industry is innovative. The idea disrupts traditional construction methods that are wasteful and resource-intensive. Score: 7/10\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) Economic Viability: The proposed business model is economically viable. It promises to reduce construction time by 30-50%, leading to substantial financial savings. However, the initial investment for setting up manufacturing facilities for modular components might be high. Score: 7/10\n",
      "\n",
      "(e) Social and Environmental Impact: The environmental impact of this idea is significant, given the potential for waste reduction and resource conservation. It also contributes to social welfare by potentially reducing construction-related pollution and promoting sustainable practices. Score: 8/10\n",

      "Final Evaluation: The proposed idea of modular construction presents a promising solution to promote circularity in the construction industry. It aligns well with the principles of a circular economy, offering significant potential for waste reduction and resource efficiency. The idea is innovative, scalable, and has a positive environmental and social impact. However, considerations around initial investment costs and regulatory compliance need to be addressed.\n",
